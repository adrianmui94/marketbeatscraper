# Marketbeat Scraper

## Introduction

Marketbeat publishes stock commentary from various brokerages on a daily basis. These can include upgrades, downgrades, reiterations and so on. The entire history of published
changes is available for everyone to see for free. This project aims to pull as many ratings as desired from the website for personal use, whether it be to backtest brokerage
accuracy or review sentiment regarding a certain ticker.

## How to Use

Simply run MarketbeatScraper.py and input a date in the form of MM/DD/YYYY. The program will then scrape every single rating from that day forward until it reaches the present.
